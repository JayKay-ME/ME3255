    "\n",
    "Python was born in the late 1980s. Its creator, [Guido van\n",

    "websites, analyzing sounds, creating games, and of course _engineering\n",
    "computations_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an _interpreted_ language. This means that you can write\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let's get started\n",
    "\n",
    "You could follow this first lesson using IPython. If you have it\n",
    "installed in the computer you're using, you enter the program by typing\n",
    "`ipython` on the command-line interface (the **Terminal** app on Mac\n",
    "OSX, and on Windows the **PowerShell** or a similar app).  A free\n",
    "service to try IPython online, right from your browser, is [Python\n",
    "Anywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/try-ipython/). You can execute\n",
    "all the examples of this lesson in IPython using this service. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use Jupyter: an environment that combines programming with\n",
    "other content, like text and images, to form a \"computational\n",
    "narrative.\" All of these lessons are written in Jupyter notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this lesson, you should open a blank\n",
    "Jupyter notebook, or are working interactively with this lesson.  On a\n",
    "blank Jupyter notebook, you should have in front of you the input line\n",
    "counter:\n",
    "\n",
    "`In[1]:`\n",
    "\n",
    "That input line is ready to receive any Python code to be executed\n",
    "interactively. The output of the code will be shown to you next to\n",
    "`Out[1]`, and so on for successive input/output lines in IPython, or\n",
    "code cells in Jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your first program\n",
    "\n",
    "In every programming class ever, your first program consists of printing\n",
    "a _\"Hello\"_ message. In Python, use the `print()` function, with your\n",
    "message inside quotation marks.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Hello world!!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You just wrote your first program and you learned how to use the\n",
    "`print()` function. Yes, `print()` is a function: we pass the _argument_\n",
    "you want the function to act on, inside the parentheses. In the case\n",
    "above, you passed a _string_, which is a series of characters between\n",
    "quotation marks. Strings will come back later in this lesson.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key concept: function\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a compact collection of code that executes some action on\n",
    "its _arguments_.  Every Python function has a _name_, used to call it,\n",
    "and takes its arguments inside round brackets. Some arguments may be\n",
    "optional (which means they have a default value defined inside the\n",
    "function), others are required. For example, the `print()` function has\n",
    "one required argument: the string of characters it should print out for\n",
    "you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python comes with many _built-in_ functions, but you can also build your\n",
    "own. Chunking blocks of code into functions is one of the best\n",
    "strategies to deal with complex programs. It makes you more efficient,\n",
    "because you can reuse the code that you wrote into a function.\n",
    "Modularity and reuse are every programmer's friends.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- #region -->\n",
    "### Python as a calculator\n",
    "\n",
    "Try any arithmetic operation in IPython or a Jupyter code cell. The\n",
    "symbols are what you would expect, except for the\n",
    "\"raise-to-the-power-of\" operator, which you obtain with two asterisks:\n",
    "`**`. Try all of these:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "+   -   *   /   **   %   //\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `%` symbol is the _modulo_ operator (divide and return the remainder), and the double-slash is _floor division_."

    "### Special variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has special variables that are built into the language. These are: \n",
    "`True`, `False`, `None` and `NotImplemented`. \n",
    "For now, you will look at just the first three of these.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Boolean variables** are used to represent truth values, and they can take one of two possible values: `True` and `False`.\n",
    "_Logical expressions_ return a boolean. Here is the simplest logical expression, using the keyword `not`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "  not True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It returns… you guessed it… `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python function `bool()` returns a truth value assigned to any argument. Any number other than zero has a truth value of `True`, as well as any nonempty string or list. The number zero and any empty string or list will have a truth value of `False`. Explore the `bool()` function with various arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "bool(0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "bool('Do we need oxygen?')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "bool('We do need oxygen')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**None is not Zero**: `None` is a special variable indicating that no value was assigned or that a behavior is undefined. It is different than the value zero, an empty string, or some other nil value. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can check that it is not zero by trying to add it to a number. Let's\n",
    "see what happens when you try that:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python jupyter={\"outputs_hidden\": true}\n",
    "a = None\n",
    "\n",
    "b = 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a + b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical and comparison operators\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python comparison operators are: `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`. They compare two objects and return either `True` or `False`: smaller than, smaller or equal, greater than, greater or equal, equal, not equal. Try it!\n",
    "\n",
    "```python jupyter={\"outputs_hidden\": true}\n",
    "x = 3\n",
    "y = 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x > y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can assign the truth value of a comparison operation to a new variable name:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python jupyter={\"outputs_hidden\": true}\n",
    "z = x > y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "z\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "type(z)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical operators are the following: `and`, `or`, and `not`. They work just like English (with the added bonus of being always consistent, not like English speakers!).  A logical expression with `and` is `True` if both operands are true, and one with `or` is `True` when either operand is true. And the keyword `not` always negates the expression that follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python jupyter={\"outputs_hidden\": true}\n",
    "a = 5\n",
    "b = 3\n",
    "c = 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a > b and b > c\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the logical operator `and` is `True` only when both operands are `True`. In the case above the first operand is `True` but the second one is `False`. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you try the `or` operation using the same operands you should get a `True`. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a > b or b > c\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And the negation of the second operand results in …\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "not b > c\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you negate the second operand in the `and` operation above?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Note: \n",
    "\n",
    "Be careful with the order of logical operations. The order of precedence in logic is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Negation\n",
    "2. And\n",
    "3. Or\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't rememeber this, make sure to use parentheses to indicate the order you want. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "What is happening in the case below? Play around with logical operators and try some examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a > b and not b > c\n",
    "```\n",
